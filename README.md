ðŸš€ Blog App: My First ASP.NET Core MVC Adventure

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This repository represents my first modern blog application, written with ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and a lot of C# codes. Every line of code holds a passion, and every function tells a story of learning. This project was not just about building a blog site, but also a journey where I discovered the building blocks of modern web development step by step.

In this project, I touched on many topics, from the magical world of Visual Studio to the database wizard Entity Framework, and even the custom search and comment systems that I coded myself. This isn't just a pile of code; it was a great adventure for me!

âœ¨ What's at the Heart of This Project?
At the core of this project lies a deep passion for writing clean and understandable code. I learned that a developer spends more time reading code than actually writing it. That's why I've extensively commented each code block to explain the why and how behind each design choice.

ðŸ’» My Tech Stack
ASP.NET Core MVC: My favorite cross-platform and open-source web framework from Microsoft. I built the foundational Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with this fantastic tool. Â  

Entity Framework Core: The coolest way to manage a database using code. Thanks to the Code-First approach, I created my database tables directly from my C# classes like Post, Comment, and Tag. Â  

Bootstrap 5: My best friend for making the site look stylish and mobile-friendly. Itâ€™s a lifesaver.Â  

Visual Studio: The heart of this project. It guided me through every step, from writing code to uploading it to Git, with its seamless integrated tools. Â  

ðŸ’Ž The Blog Application's Shining Features
Beyond the basic blog functions, I added some extra features to make my application more functional and modern:

Dynamic Homepage: It automatically pulls the 5 most recent posts from the database, giving visitors instant access to fresh content.

Smart Search Bar: Finding the post you want is now effortless! You can filter posts by searching for keywords in the title or content.

Commenting System: I added the ability for readers to leave comments on each post, making the blog more interactive.

Rich Text Editor: No more plain text! I integrated a rich text editor (TinyMCE) so I can format my posts with images, lists, and different styles, allowing for more creative content.

Organized Folder Structure: Based on the MVC principles I learned, I organized my code into clear folders like Controllers, Views, and Models. This keeps the project clean and easy to manage as it grows. Â
